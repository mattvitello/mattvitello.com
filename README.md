# mattvitello.com
My simple SPA of a website.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy
The app is hosted via GitHub Pages. Build the app and then copy the contents from `dist/` to `docs/`. 

GitHub Pages only recognizes builds from the `root folder` or from the `docs folder` so we do what we must to not complicate the process of making changes to this very simple app.
